# Slack
A repository for the Slack coding challenge.

On opening, this app will access the slack userlist via the API and it 
will display a scrollable listview of the users in the group. When one
of the users is selected, the app will open a new activity view that
displays the user's profile picture, username, real name, and title. 

If the app is subsequently opened without an internet connection, the same
information will display. Unfortunately, the image will not display without 
an internet connection. I ran out of time while writing this app and was
not able to finish adding functionality for saving an image offline.

If it is a problem that I was unable to get the image displaying without
a network connection, please let me know, and I will try to find extra time
to fix it.
